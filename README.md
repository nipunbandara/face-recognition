## Face Recognition Application

Welcome! This application leverages a prebuilt face recognition model with predefined class names for quick and easy deployment.

### 🚀 Features
- **Instant Recognition:** Uses a ready-to-go model for immediate results.
- **Easy Integration:** No complex setup required.

### 🔧 Custom Model Training

Want to recognize different faces or classes?  
You can train your own model using our [Model Creation Tool](https://github.com/nipunbandara/face-recognition-model.git).  
This allows you to define custom class names and tailor the recognition system to your needs.

### 🔄 Replacing the Default Model

To use your own trained model, simply replace the existing model file in the `public` directory of this project.  
Make sure your new model follows the required format and naming conventions as described in the [Model Creation Tool documentation](https://github.com/nipunbandara/face-recognition-model.git).

After replacing the model, restart the application to load your custom model for recognition.

### 🌟 Planned Updates

- **Automated Model Training:**  
    Soon, you'll be able to train models with custom class names directly from the client application—no separate tools or manual steps required!

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!
